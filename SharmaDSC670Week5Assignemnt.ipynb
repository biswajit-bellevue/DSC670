Instead an `example` of `email body` and corresponding expected `json` output were provided in the prompt. The `examples` enabled the LLM to steer it response to the desired output including all the details. The LLM was able to infer the prices of each kind of shoes from the example itself. The output json has all the attributes exactly as mentioned in the example in this case.\n",

However, even though cost was higher we were able to get more tailored response. Therefore, cost and output performance must be evaluated before choosing the type of prompting for a task."
