    "RAG is a technique of optimizing the output of a large language models that involves referencing a knowledge outside of its training data sources before generating a response. RAG can be used to augment the LLM knowledge with information that was not part of the original training data. In the below activity RAG approach is used with OpenAPI LLM model (chatgp-4o-mini) which have a knowledge cut-off date of `July-2024`. Hence, gpt-4o-mini model will not be able to accurately answer information about events that happened after the `cut-off` date. However, it may still make up some answer even it was not part of training data, but that may be false or not trustworthy. Using, RAG approach relevant and trustworthy response can be received by passing the additional data in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, question about wildfires that happened in January 2025 will be sent to LLM `without RAG approach`, and the same questions will be again asked by providing information in the context about California 2025 wildfires from Wikipedia web page `January 2025 Souther California` using `RAG approach`.  Then the responses will be investigated."
